			<div id = "item2"><p>Every Summertime is a feel good song for sure. Something to keep you upbeat, and that's what this song does for me personally. Having heard her songs before, I knew that I would likely appreciate her up and coming songs. I was also elated to find out that she (and Seori) were included in the Shang-Chi and The Legend of the Ten Rings soundtrack and felt that they both deserved it. As for the song, it is also something that can be played on loop and will not get tired of it.</p>
