			<div id = "item2"><p>It was difficult to choose a song from Gorillaz, since I knew that I wanted to add them to the list but couldn't figure out which song to add. I decided on Andromeda becuse I knew I wanted to choose a song from the album Humanz, but also wanted a more chill song to represent from the album as well. Also the music video is very satisfying to watch, the color, the planet lighting up when the meteor in the video hits it, and also just fitting for the title of the track to have a space theme. Unrelated but reasonable to why I chose Gorillaz as well, I remember follwing the story and watching the lore behind the characters, and how previous music videos were continuations of a story, and remembering that made me want to add them to the list.</p>
