			<div id = "item2"><p>Raincoat was catchy from the first time I heard it, with its catchy drums and lyrics to support it. It's relatively short compared to the other songs, but it is also what made it catchy and replayable. This is also one of the more upbeat songs that I have on the list. I believe that the instruments as well make up for both the upbeat-ness and the catchability of the song.</p>
