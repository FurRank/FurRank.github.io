			<div id = "item2"><p>The build up to the vocals is something that strikes me, and to then keep this synth-like instrument consistent in the background adds on to the song. The multitude of instruments that keep on getting added on and played throughout are what make up the song. I have heard of the featured artist before, Yukika, and to have her collaborate with FreeTEMPO was something unexpected but definitely worth to me. </p>
