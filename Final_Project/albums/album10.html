			<div id = "item2"><p>Last is Fragile by Tatsuro Yamashita. This song is an overall vibe to chill and listen to. It would be personally uncanny to not include Tatsuro Yamashita since I first heard his work near the beginning of highschool from a vaporwave of one of songs. After that, I came to love the genre of city pop, along with other common vaporwave remixes of popular city pop songs. Also, it was a huge surprise when another popular city pop artist, Mariya Takeuchi, were together and married, and made me excited when I found out. Fragile and his other works are an overall bop to listen to, would recommend to all without a doubt.</p>
