			<div id = "item2"><p>This song is one of the older songs that I have on the list as I kept listening to it since the end of highschool (2016). There's a reason why this song stuck to me for so long and that's because it is a mood kind of song, in which it's a song that I play whenever I feel down since I believe that a song matching your mood is best played at that moment. Lyrics wise, when translated, it tells a somber story that is short and worth analyzing.</p></div>
