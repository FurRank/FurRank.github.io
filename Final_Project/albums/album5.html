			<div id = "item2"><p>The first time I heard it, I knew that I would add it to one of my playlists and listen to it on and on later. It has the same vibes as The Night by Lovewave, and that's another reason on why I thought I would instantly love listening to it. I feel that the song is both somber and light-hearted at the same time, somber because of instruments and the face that it is a slow beat, but light-hearted coming from the lyrics that are supported by her voice. The best part comes in two minutes and forty-five seconds into the song as her voice is the loudest at this point compared to the other parts of the song as if she's singing her heart out.</p>
