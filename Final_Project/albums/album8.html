			<div id = "item2"><p>I can't remember if I had heard this song before Baby Driver, where it was featured for a bit, or heard it during the movie, but I remember when it did play, I was captured by the chorus of the song. For it to have a long build up is worth listening to the rest of the song, and if the song was not upbeat enough, the chorus brings it all around, especially the last chrous. When the chorus comes on, it's irresistable to not play the lyrics in my head, and to add-on, his voice fits this kind of music perfectly.</p></div>
