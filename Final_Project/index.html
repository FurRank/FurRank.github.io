				<h1 style = "font-size:30px;">Welcome to my personal music library! Here are 10 of my personal favorite (in no particular order) songs.</h1> <p style = "font-size:20px">The options available are "Previous" and "Next", self explanatory. "Preview", which allows you to preview the song you are currently looking at, and "Pause", which pauses the current song you are previewing. Lastly, click on the album to hear the full song and see my personal reasonings of choosing said song.<p>
				<p style = "font-size:10px">*I highly recommend using the buttons as a means of moving through, i.e. using the "Back" button instead of using your browsers back button, etc.<p>
